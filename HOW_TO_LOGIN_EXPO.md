## 🚀 Alternative: Build Without Web Login

If you can't log in to the web dashboard, we can try these alternatives:

### **Option 1: Fix the CLI Build**
We can try to fix the Windows path issue by:
1. Installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
2. Running the build from WSL instead of Windows PowerShell

### **Option 2: Use Expo Go for Testing**
Instead of building an APK, you can:
1. Install "Expo Go" app from Play Store
2. Run `npm start` in your project
3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go
4. Test the app directly without building

### **Option 3: Wait for Email Notification**
If a build was already triggered (even if it failed), you might receive an email with build details.
